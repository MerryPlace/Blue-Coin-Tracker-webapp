# Blue Coin Tracker Web App

Since there's no ingame tool for keeping track of blue coins, they're notoriously hard to find! Many have tried and failed to finish this tricky challenge, but with this tool 100% completion is within reach!

Blue Coin Tracker is an unofficial Super Mario Sunshine companion app. The app is intended to assist players in keeping track of their blue coin progress while also providing a helpful guide and videos right at their fingertips.

## Ported to React

This project was originally developed as an android app written in Kotlin. Due to it's popularity, I've ported it to React so that users can access it with no device limitations!
